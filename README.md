### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I always like to prioritize design. I feel that user experience is equal to app performance, so it is something I like to try to implement.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

This is hard to answer, as I was talking with Marisa, my father has been in ICU for a couple months now and a lot of my time has been spent with him out of town. In total it took two weeks, but how much time was spent writing code, I am not sure.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

No, I can't say that I did. I typically design the application UI and UML diagram before writing any code, so I knew what I wanted before going into the project.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

The lack of unit tests. I have around two years of experience as an iOS developer, and I have yet to see anyone write their own unit tests. At my previous job, there was someone dedicated to doing just that. At my bootcamp, we were not taught to write unit tests, so I was under the impression, so far with my experience, that it wasn't something developers did on their own. Unfortunately for my situation and the time restraint I had, I didn't want to spend any more time learning it. It is something that I have looked into and have just recently purchased a book and will begin doing online tutorial to be better at it.

Another part of the project I would like to be better at is SwiftUI. All of my experience has been with UIKit and I havent made the jump to SwiftUI fully. Prior to being laid off, we did begin to redesign the application to SwiftUI, but nothing major. It is a fun language and I am excited to learn more.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I think I explained most of it under Weakest Part of the Project. I know I have much more to learn about SwiftUI and the entore software development lifecycle, but I am excited to do it with a team at Fetch and at a position that will allow me to do just that.
